<b>Asian Green</b><br/>
Depending on which part of the plants you use, fast-growing Asian greens can slip into several culinary roles, and all plants are excellent sources of calcium and vitamins A, C and K. 
<br/><br/>
Shown here, from left to right, are Chinese cabbage, red mustard, mizuna, bok choy and edible chrysanthemum.
<br/><b>Types to Try</b>
<br/>
Leafy greens of Asian ancestry include mustard cousins such as mizuna, mustard spinach and tatsoi. Red-leafed mustards and garland chrysanthemum offer more variations in flavor and texture.
<br/><br/>
Leaf ribs or crisp stems of Chinese cabbage and bok choy bring plenty of crunch to stir-fries and salads. Miniature forms of both are great for small gardens.
<br/><br/>
Tender flower buds come from special varieties of flowering brassicas, which may have a broccoli or a mustard pedigree.

<b>How to Plant Asian Greens</b>
<br/>
All Asian greens grow best in moist, fertile, well-drained soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5. 
<br/><br/>
Choose a sunny site, loosen the soil to at least 12 inches deep, and thoroughly mix in a layer of mature compost. 
<br/><br/>
Sow seeds about 2 inches apart and a quarter inch deep, then water well to settle the seeds into the soil. After seeds germinate (often in less than five days), gradually thin them to proper spacing. 
<br/><br/>
Large Chinese cabbage, Chinese broccoli and flowering mustard should be thinned to 14 inches apart, but small bok choy plants do well with just 6 inches between plants.
