<b>Types of Blackberries</b>
<br/>
<b>Erect blackberries</b> can be grown as a head-high hedge that needs little or no support when properly pruned. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Good erect blackberry</b> varieties include ‘Navaho’ (which are thornless) and numerous varieties with thorns, including ‘Illini Hardy’ and ‘Darrow.’
<br/><br/>
<b>Semi-trailing blackberries</b> need a fence or trellis to keep them upright, but with good pruning these thornless varieties can produce very high yields. 
<br/><br/>
Good varieties include ‘Chester,’ ‘Doyle,’ ‘Natchez’ and ‘Triple Crown.’
<br/>
<b>Trailing blackberries</b> grow long, wandering canes that need guidance and pruning, like climbing roses. 
<br/><br/>
At their best in the cool Northwest, the ‘Marionberry’ cultivar has thorns, but ‘Waldo’ and ‘Loch Ness’ are thornless.
<br/><br/>
<b>Primocane blackberries</b> bear on the current season’s growth, starting in midsummer. 
<br/><br/>
Varieties such as ‘Prime Jim’ and ‘Prime Jan’ (both thorny) can extend the blackberry season into early fall, or make blackberry production possible where cold winters cause cane injury in other blackberry varieties.
<br/><br/>
<b>How to Plant Blackberries</b>
<br/><br/>
Growing blackberries is easy in a sunny to partially shaded spot that has well-drained soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5. 
<br/><br/>
Enrich the site with plenty of organic matter so that the top 6 inches of soil will retain moisture well. 
<br/><br/>
In garden-size plantings, allow 4 feet between erect and semi-trailing blackberry plants, or 6 to 8 feet between trailing varieties. 
<br/><br/>
Single plants of very productive varieties such as ‘Triple Crown’ can be grown on an upright pillar, or you can plant two or three plants together in a mound. 
<br/><br/>
Plant crowns about 3 inches deep, and water well.
