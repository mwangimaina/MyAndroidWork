<b>Artichokes</b>
Artichokes aren’t the easiest crop to prepare in your kitchen, but their rich flavors are worth the work. 
<br/><br/>
Grow some in your garden to experience a real treat.
<br/><br/>
<b>Types of Artichokes</b><br/>
Green artichoke varieties include ‘Imperial Star,’ the best variety to handle as an annual, and ‘Green Globe,’ a heavy-bearing perennial hardy to Zone 7.
<br/><br/>
Purple artichokes include ‘Violetta,’ an heirloom variety hardy to Zone 6, and the fast-maturing ‘Opera’ hybrid.
<br/><b>How to Plant Artichokes</b><br/>
Start artichoke seeds indoors in late winter, under bright florescent lights. 
<br/><br/>
The large seeds will germinate within a week at warm room temperatures, and seedlings should be potted into larger containers as they grow. 
<br/><br/>
Six weeks before your last frost date, start hardening off seedlings by gradually exposing them to bright sun, wind and cool temperatures.
<br/><br/>
Set artichoke plants out in prepared beds 3 to 4 weeks before your last frost date. Exposure to cool temperatures below 45 degrees is necessary to trigger flowering. 
<br/><br/>
Before transplanting artichokes, enrich each planting hole with a balanced organic fertilizer, and space plants 3 feet apart.
