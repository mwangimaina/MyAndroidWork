<b>Types of Cauliflower</b>
<br/>
Cauliflower varieties vary in growth rate and color. 
<br/><br/>
Almost all common varieties are hybrids.
<br/><br/>
<b>Early cauliflower</b> varieties such as ‘Snow Crown,’ ‘Denali’ and green-headed ‘Panther’ mature about 70 to 80 days after planting, so they are a good choice for climates where fall weather does not last long. 
<br/><br/>
However, the heads of early cauliflower varieties are not as large, dense and sweet as those that mature later.
<br/><br/>
<b>Main-season cauliflower</b> varieties need more than 80 days after transplanting to mature, but the large heads are worth the wait. 
<br/><br/>
In addition to growing cauliflower varieties with white heads such as ‘Candid Charm’ and ‘Skywalker,’ try purple cauliflower such as ‘Graffiti’ or ‘Orange Burst’ orange cauliflower, which has more vitamin A than other types of cauliflower.
<br/><br/>
<b>How to Plant Cauliflower</b>
<br/><br/>
Unlike cabbage and broccoli, cauliflower can rarely be grown successfully from plants set out in spring. 
<br/><br/>
Hot weather that arrives just as spring-planted cauliflower heads up ruins its flavor and texture, and the plants become magnets for insects.
<br/><br/>
A much better planting schedule is to wait until late spring or early summer to start cauliflower seeds. 
<br/><br/>
Recommended seeding dates for a few locations include May 30 in Maine and Ontario, June 15 in New York, July 1 in Kentucky, July 15 in Alabama, and October 15 in Arizona. 
<br/><br/>
Harden off the seedlings before setting them out in well-prepared soil, and plan to cover them with lightweight row cover or tulle to exclude insect pests.
